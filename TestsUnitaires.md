Unit Testing

The idea of unit testing is to test if individual pieces of code do what they
are supposed to. These "pieces" are as small as possible, for example methods
in object oriented programming.  I suggest we use a framework called JUnit to
write and carry out the tests, because it is supported by Eclipse.

The way I see it, some of the greatest benefits of JUnit and unit testing in
general are

  1. separation of the test code and "real" code
> 2. having a test-suite easily run, so that every time a new feature is added or an old feature is modified, we can test all existing code with a single click and make sure everything still runs ok.

I will not a write a tutorial as plenty of them can be found on the Web. Here's
a link to a very beginner friendly French tutorial:
